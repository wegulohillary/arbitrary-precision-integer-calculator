# Arbitrary Precision Calculator

This project implements an arbitrary-precision integer calculator in C. It supports essential operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, factorials, and more.

## Features

- **Arbitrary Precision**: Handles numbers with thousands of digits.
- **Operations**:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulo (`%`)
  - Exponentiation (`^`)
  - Factorial (`!`)
- **Interactive REPL**: A simple command-line interface for user input.
